Android App, reminders and such.

#Introduction
I am a computer science student trying to get into android development and help people suffering from ADHD by creating a way 
for them to better organize their days through being reminded to do things.  It is not a basic reminder application(because those already
exist at a level beyond my skill).  I plan on utilizing greedy algorithms to best adapt to the users needs, by (optionally) sorting the
order of their reminders. 

I do not intend on allowing my code to be changed by others, however any input on my code/coding techniques is more than welcome.

# current information
As of 12/12/2017 the application only has one type of a reminder and a very basic UI that crashes often.
